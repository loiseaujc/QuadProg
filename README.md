### Description

This is an updated version of the `quadprog` solver initially written by Berwin A. Turlach in Fortran 77. It can be used to solve strictly convex quadratic programs of the form

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{minimize}   &   \quad   \dfrac12 \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{Px} - \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{q} \\
\mathrm{subject~to} &   \quad   \mathbf{Ax} = \mathbf{b}    \\
                    &   \quad   \mathbf{Cx} \geq \mathbf{d}.
\end{aligned}
$$

using an [active set method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active-set_method). It is most efficient for small to moderate sized QP described using dense matrices.

**Updates to the original code include:**
 - Sources have been translated from FORTRAN 77 fixed-form to Fortran 90 free-form.
 - All obsolescent features (`goto`, etc) have been removed. It is now 100% standard compliant (Fortran 2018).
 - It makes use of derived-type and easy to use interfaces. The `qp_problem` class is used to defined the quadratic program and `solve` to compute its solution.
 - Calls to `blas` functions and subroutines now replace some hand-crafted implementations for improved performances.
 - Calls to `lapack` subroutines now replace the original functionalities provided by [`linpack`](https://www.netlib.org/linpack/).
 - Utility solvers for non-negative least-squares (`nnls`) and bounded-variables least-squares (`bvls`) are provided.


### Building QuadProg

#### Fortran Package Manager

The library can be built with the [Fortran Package Manager](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) `fpm` using the provided `fpm.toml` file like so:

```bash
fpm build --release
```

Only double precision (`real64`) is currently supported.

To use `QuadProg` within your `fpm` project, add the following to your `fpm.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
QuadProg = { git="https://github.com/loiseaujc/QuadProg.git"}
```

### Dependencies

The library requires some [`blas`](https://netlib.org/blas/) and [`lapack`](https://www.netlib.org/lapack/) routines which are not included. You thus need to have it available on your system, otherwise it'll automatically pull them from the fortran standard library [`stdlib`](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib).

### Example

The following program solves the QP

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{minimize}   &   \quad   \dfrac12 \left( x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 \right) - 5 x_2   \\
\mathrm{subject~to} &   \quad   -4x_1 + 2x_2 \geq -8    \\
                    &   \quad   -3x_1 + x_2 - 2x_3 \geq -2  \\
                    &   \quad   x_3 \geq 0.
\end{aligned}
$$

    use quadprog
    implicit none
    integer, parameter :: dp = selected_real_kind(15, 307)
    ! Size of the problem.
    integer, parameter :: n = 3
    ! Quadratic cost.

    integer :: i

    !> Setup the quadratic function..
    P = 0.0_dp ; q = [0.0_dp, 5.0_dp, 0.0_dp]
    do i = 1, n
        P(i, i) = 1.0_dp
    enddo
    
    !> Setup the inequality constraints.
    C(:, 1) = [-4.0_dp, 2.0_dp, 0.0_dp]
    C(:, 2) = [-3.0_dp, 1.0_dp, -2.0_dp]
    C(:, 3) = [0.0_dp, 0.0_dp, 1.0_dp]
    d = [-8.0_dp, 2.0_dp, 0.0_dp]

    !> Solve the inequality constrained QP.
    prob = qp_problem(P, q, C=C, d=d)
    solution = solve(prob)

    if (solution%success) then
        print *, "x   =", solution%x ! Solution of the QP.
        print *, "y   =", solution%y ! Lagrange multipliers.
        print *, "obj =", solution%obj ! Objective function.
    endif
end program
```
